## üéì My words
In this course, the Professor is so kind and professional, he knows detials and will ask you lots of questions about the 3 homeworks.
You need to read all the matiral, finish and complete all the homeworks, after this, you need to remember all the notes I gave you.
And then you will know the core of the course, and what the professor wants you to learn and talk in oral exam.
Good luck, the professor is kind, so don't worry.
